The animated GIF of the Moire pattern was supplied by CompaniaHill from The Fleet Workshop.

This code was provided by Adafruit from their Clue Sensor Plotter example (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Arcada/blob/master/examples/full_board_tests/arcada_clue_sensorplotter/arcada_clue_sensorplotter.ino) with their Animated GIF code. 

The integration of the Moire pattern, thermal camera, and Bluetooth was done by notSpock on The Fleet Workshop.
